# Alien_Invasion
This is a project called Alien Invasion from Python crush course.
I made this project during my python learning journy.
This increase my confidence in building prjects and using the Libreries of python.
It feels amazing to play a game that build by yourself even if the game is not your creative work.

## How to play
Press the **space key** to attack the enemy<br/>
Move the ship left and right by using **left and right key** and beat your high score<br/>
